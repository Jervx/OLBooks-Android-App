It is a vivid demonstration of both the ancient reach and the continuing relevance of mythology in the lives of the Chinese people.<~>Compiled from ancient and scattered texts and based on groundbreaking new research, Handbook of Chinese Mythology is the most comprehensive English-language work on the subject ever written from an exclusively Chinese perspective. This work focuses on the Han Chinese people but ranges across the full spectrum of ancient and modern China, showing how key myths endured and evolved over time. A quick reference section covers all major deities, spirits, and demigods, as well as important places (Kunlun Mountain), mythical animals and plants (the crow with three feet; Fusang tree), and related items (Xirang-a kind of mythical soil; Bu Si Yao-mythical medicine for long life). No other work captures so well what Chinese mythology means to the people who lived and continue to live their lives by it.<~>With more than 40 illustrations and photographs, fresh translations of primary sources, and insight based on the authors' own field research, Handbook of Chinese Mythology offers an illuminating account of a fascinating corner of the world of myth.", OlbookUtils.toISODateString(format.parse("13/03/2008")), OlbookUtils.toISODateString(new Date()), "handbook_of_chinese_mythology.pdf", 4497, 5214);

Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks. The Bitcoin Standard analyzes the historical context to the rise of Bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications.<~>While Bitcoin is an invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. Author Saifedean Ammous takes the reader on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the reader with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied civilizational collapse.<~>With this background in place, the book moves on to explain the operation of Bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin’s real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for the final settlement of large payments―a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure.<~>The final chapter of the book explores some of the most common questions surrounding Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin mining a waste of energy? Is Bitcoin for criminals? Who controls Bitcoin, and can they change it if they please? How can Bitcoin be killed? And what to make of all the thousands of Bitcoin knockoffs, and the many supposed applications of Bitcoin’s ‘block chain technology’?

Dalton<~> Shirley Strutton Dalton ","Religion<~>belief<~>Life", "“Jesus Never Lived! Volume 1 Jesus Christ: A Pagan Myth” 3rd Revised and Expanded Edition (Over 225 pages have been added to the previous edition). “Jesus Christ: A Pagan Myth” explores the pagan origins of Christianity and shows that Jesus Christ never lived. This book is for doubting Christians, x-believers, atheists, agnostics, and those who are just plain curious about whether a man could walk on water! We have focused on the evidence of the Roman Empire in the first and early second centuries CE. Part 1 is a 170 page detailed analysis of the Gospel of Mark. It shows that the religious beliefs of Mark were derived from the pagan world. The Gospel is a pagan myth in Jewish dress, as Bruno Bauer pointed out more than 100 years ago. Our analysis deals with questions like: Why does Mark share anti-Jewish beliefs like those of the pagan historian, Tacitus? Why are the last words of Jesus dying on the cross: "Why have you (God) abandoned me?" (Why does Jesus feel he is dying a failure, that he has been abandoned by God?) Part 2 Who Created Jesus? Paul was a member of a mystery religion; otherwise, why is there a striking similarity between the religion of Paul and the pagan mystery religions which surrounded him? The 225 pages of Part 2 provide a detailed analysis which shows that the Paulinists (followers of Paul) created the Jesus of the Gospel of Mark, or at least proto-Mark. The reader may wonder, if the followers of Paul created the Markan Jesus how do we deal with the following questions? Why does Paul’s cosmic savior, the triumphant divine Christ, not appear in the Markan Gospel but rather Jesus, a human failure dying in despair on the cross? Why were Jesus and his disciples spiritually defective (Jesus’s lack of faith of Jesus on the cross; Peter’s three denials of Jesus)? Why does Paul know nothing about the historical Jesus Christ of Mark’s Gospel? (Paul does not know that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, performed miracles, taught people, was tried by Pilate, and died in Jerusalem, etc.) How was it that Paul’s savior offered salvation to all (at least to non-Jews), whereas the mission of Mark’s historical Jesus was only to Jews? Why does the human Jesus become semi-divine in the birth scenes in Matthew and Luke and totally divine in John’s Gospel? “Jesus Never Lived! Volume 1 Jesus Christ: A Pagan Myth” answers all of the questions listed above and more. The 400+ pages provide much evidence to show that Jesus is a pagan myth in Jewish dress. Jesus never existed. For more, see the Look Inside feature for the Table of Contents etc. Also, see: “Jesus Never Lived! Volume 2 Jesus and Plato on Hell” is a supplemental volume which examines the Pagan views on how one is saved and on the afterlife as found in Plato and the Stoic writings of Seneca. These pagan views are compared with the Christian views found in the Gospel of Mark and the letters of Paul. Our conclusion is that the Christian views on salvation and the nature of the afterlife were derived from the pagan world, thus providing more evidence for the mythical Jesus. Jesus Christ never lived. Jesus is a pagan myth. Christ is a literary fiction. “Jesus Never Lived! Volume 3 The Pagan Morals of Jesus Christ” provides supplementary evidence that Jesus is a pagan myth by showing that Christian ethics were derived from the pagan world, particularly from the Roman Stoics.", OlbookUtils.toISODateString(format.parse("20/04/2013")), OlbookUtils.toISODateString(new Date()), "jesus_never_lived_volume_jesus_christ.pdf", 11322, 3242);
